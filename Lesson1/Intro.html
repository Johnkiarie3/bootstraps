<h1>FEMINISM IN KENYA</h1>
<h6>What is feminism?</h6>
<p name="Description" style="color:red"
    Feminism simply put can be seen as a movement for social, political and economic equality of
men and women.It can also mean engaging with the government, the law, the social and
cultural practices and beliefs of the society and participating in the gainful  economic activity
“all with a goal” of bringing equality among the sexes.<br>1.) Feminism has also been defined as an
ideology that seeks equality of both men and women. It deconstructs patriarchy and promotes
gender equality. It also advocates the transformation of all social relations of power that
oppress, exploit or marginalize any set of people‐  women and men, on the basis of their
gender, age, sexual orientation, ability, race, religion, nationality, location, ability, class, caste
or ethnicity.<br>2.)Feminism appeared, for the first time, as early as the 19th Century, the century of large
emancipatory, social movements, as an international social movement with an autonomous
identity with theoretical and organizational structure, central to other important social
movements, including various socialism and anarchism.</p>

<p>Feminism is a diverse, competing and often opposing collection of social theories, political
movements and moral philosophies largely motivated by or concerning the experience of
women, especially in terms of their social, political and economic inequalities. One
institutionally predominant type of feminism focuses on limiting or eliminating gender
inequality to promote women’s rights, interests and issues in society.</p>
