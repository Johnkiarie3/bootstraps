<h3 style="color:white;">What is AI?</h3>

<div id="main-content"></div>

<p style="margin-top:20px;"> <b>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled
   robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.AI technology is
   widely used throughout industry, government, and science.<br>Some high-profile applications
   are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by
   YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), interacting via human speech (such as Google Assistant,
   Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT
    and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).<hr> </b> </p>
    <div id="sub-content"></div>

       <p> Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called Machine Intelligence:<br>
[1] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.<br>[2] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism
<br>[3] followed by disappointment and loss of funding.<br>[4] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep
learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,<br>[5] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.<br>[6] This led to the AI
spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant
advances in artificial intelligence<hr></p>

<h3 style="color:white;">Types of Artficial Intelligence</h3>

<h4 class="h4">1.) Reactive machines.</h4>

<p>Reactive machines are AI systems that have no memory and are task specific, meaning that an input
    always delivers the same output.  </p>

  <h4 class="h4">2.) Theory of Mind</h4>

 <p>The first two types of AI, reactive machines and limited memory, are types that currently exist. Theory of mind and self-aware AI are
    theoretical types that could be built in the future.
        <h4 id="h43">3.) Self- Awareness</h4>

<p>This goes a step beyond theory of mind AI and understanding emotions to being aware of themselves, their state of being,
    and being able to sense or predict others’ feelings.  </p>

  <h4 class="h4">4.) limited memory machines</h4>

<p>Limited memory AI, unlike reactive machines, can look into the past and monitor specific objects or situations over time.
    Then, these observations are programmed into the AI so that its actions can be performed based on both past and present moment data.

machine learning algorithm, which is used for classification tasks, like text classification.
    It is also part of a family of generative learning algorithms, meaning that it seeks to model the distribution of inputs
     of a given class or category.--></p>
